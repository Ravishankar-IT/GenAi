#Generative AI Engineering – Learning & Implementation

This repository showcases my hands-on learning and implementation of Generative AI systems with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and real-world application development.
It demonstrates my ability to understand GenAI concepts, work with model APIs, and integrate AI-driven features into scalable software solutions.
