# Generative AI Engineering – Learning & Implementation

## Overview
This repository showcases my hands-on learning and implementation of **Generative AI systems**, with a strong focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, prompt engineering, and real-world application development. It reflects my ability to work with GenAI APIs, design effective prompts, and integrate AI-driven features into scalable software solutions.

## Technical Focus Areas
- Architecture and working principles of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- Prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)
- Text generation, summarization, classification, and conversational AI
- API-based interaction with Generative AI models
- Response optimization, validation, and error handling
- Responsible AI usage and basic safety considerations

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python  
- **AI/ML:** LLM-based Generative AI models  
- **Frameworks & Tools:**
  - Node.js / Python runtime
  - REST APIs for model integration
  - Environment configuration (dotenv, API keys)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
